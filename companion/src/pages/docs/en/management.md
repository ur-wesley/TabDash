# Setting Management

There are two ways to manage your settings. You can save it encrypted to the cloud, or you can locally save it to a file.
If the `save online` toggle is active, the settings get saved in the cloud.

### export

Hitting the export button without the `save online` option, TabDash copies the settings to the clipboard. If the toggle is active,
you can save the settings encrypted\* with your password to the cloud.

### import

Hitting the import button without the `save online` option, TabDash tries to parse the settings from your local clipboard. If the toggle is active, you have to enter a valid setting id and a password, to recover your settings from the cloud.

### reset

The reset button deletes all settings and set the default settings.

> _\***encryption** means that the content is encrypted with a passwort. The passwort wont be saved. The en- and decryption happens on the server site._
